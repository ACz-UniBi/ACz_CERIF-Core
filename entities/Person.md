The kind of involvement of a Person in the research ecosystem is specified in the links with the organisations, the services, etc. This typically includes:
1. researchers (Persons performing research in an Organisation Unit as employees or students);
2. authors and other contributors (Persons signing a publication, creators of data sets, software developers, etc.);
3. investigators and project participants (Persons involved in a Project as principal investigators, co investigators, project managers, consultants, etc.);
4. management (directors, rectors, deans, department heads, etc.);
5. support staff (technicians, responsible for Equipment, librarians and digital asset curators, administrative staff, etc.).

One Person typically has many of these relationships.
