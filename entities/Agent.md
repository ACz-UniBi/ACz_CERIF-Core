# Agent

## Definition

Anything that has the ability to perform actions.

## Usage notes

Currently either [Person](../entities/Person.md) 
or [Organisation Unit](../entities/Organisation_Unit.md),
for future extension.

## Relationships

[FIXME]
An agent is the target of too many relationships to list: 
anywhere where an actor is given.
These relationships are typically navigable both ways.
