# Application

## Definition
A formal request to be considered for a position or to be allowed to do or have something, submitted to an authority, institution, or organization.<sup>[1](#fn1)</sup>

## Usage notes
Applications reference an explicit [Call for Applications](../entities/Call_for_Applications.md) (e.g. a funding call or call for nominations for an award).

Applications, when submitted, typically enter some kind of process which results in an [Evaluation Outcome](../entities/Evaluation_Outcome.md).
Based on one or more such outcomes, a [Decision](../entities/Decision.md) is made.

This entity represents the act of applying rather than the application [Document](../entities/Document.md). 

Subclasses specify the nature of the application as well the details. 
An application typically contains the request (what is proposed to happen) and its justification (what benefits it would bring).
