# Local Agent ID Type

## Definition

The datatype that represents a local identifier. It is based on the [String](../datatypes/String.md) without any restriction.

## Notes

If some restriction is needed for a specific local identifier, Local Agent ID Type should be specialized by defining regular expression
or any other restriction over String. An example of defining restriction over String can be found in the definition of [ISNI ID](../datatypes/ISNI_ID.md).  
An example of defining specification of a data type can be found in the relation between [Postal Address](../datatypes/Postal_Address.md) and 
[Structured Postal Address](../datatypes/Structured_Postal_Address.md)
